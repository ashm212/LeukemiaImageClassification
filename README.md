# LeukemiaImageClassification
This repository contains the python code that I wrote to process leukemia images and diagnose ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)

The images are downloaded from this kaggle project: 
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/leukemia-classification

The all folders contain images of cells that are identified with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and the HEM folder contains the ones that do not.
